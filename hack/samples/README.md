# Sample Code

Sample code demonstrating how to use the image-registry-operator-api in your project

## Prerequisites

The sample code sets up a local Kubernetes cluster and populates it with
image-registry-operator-api CRD types. In order to successfully run the samples,
these types need to be generated with `make generate-manifests` in the project
root. This is also done automatically if you run `make all` in the samples directory.

## Controller Client Samples

The client in `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client` take a different
approach to managing custom resources. It is both dynamic and opinionated
and it's what you will likely use if you build a controller using kubebuilder.
Note that it doesn't provide a Watch function as watching resources is a
capability inherent to a controller.

Note that the scheme for the image-registry-operator-api needs to be
explicitly added to the client.

## Build and run

Building and running the samples is really simple

```bash
cd hack/samples
make all
bin/list-ctrl
```
