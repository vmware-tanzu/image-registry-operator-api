# image-registry-operator-api

## Overview

The image-registry-operator-api provides the object model and generated
client libraries for VM Image Service, which is part of
[vSphere with Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-with-Tanzu/index.html).

VM Image Service allows users to manage the lifecycle of vSphere
Content Library Items using a declarative Kubernetes consumption
model and is an integral part of vSphere with Tanzu.

The state of `ContentLibrary` and `ContentLibraryItem` CRDs in a Supervisor
is monitored by the built-in controllers which reconcile the
CRD specification into Content Libraries and Content Library Items in
vSphere. The state of the Content Libraries and Content Library Items
in vSphere is reflected back in the `ContentLibrary` and `ContentLibraryItem`
CRD status.

## Try it out

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating
image-registry-operator-api into your project.

### Prerequisites

VM Image Service currently requires vSphere with Tanzu.
What this means in functional terms is that you can manage workloads
in a given Workload Namespace using a Kubernetes client connected
directly to an embedded Kubernetes API Server running in the Supervisor.
VM Image Service currently allows you to monitor
`ClusterContentLibrary` and `ClusterContentLibraryItem` objects
that exist in the Supervisor and `ContentLibrary` and `ContentLibraryItem`
objects that exist in the Supervisor Workload namespace.
The support to be able to create and manage them will be added soon.

### Testing sample code

Package envtest provides libraries for integration testing by starting
a local control plane. Control plane binaries (etcd and kube-apiserver)
are loaded by default from /usr/local/kubebuilder/bin. This can be
overridden by setting the KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS environment variable, or
by directly creating a control plane for the Environment to use.

By building the `list-ctrl` target, the tools target gets built too
and the kubebuilder tool binaries are downloaded to the `tools/bin`
folder and the KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS points to the location where the binaries
are downloaded.

### Build and Test the sample code

make list-ctrl
./hack/samples/bin/list-ctrl
